# Running the analysis and exploring the results

## asr-per-tree-for-cldf-data.R

Run the ancestral state reconstruciton analysis: rates and states.

## d_for_cldf_data.R

Run the analysis on phylogenetic signal as D.

## collect.R

Collect the results on D, rates and states into three dataframes

## explore_results.R

Create a table with summary statistics for D, rates and states.
Create all plots used in the article, except for the heatmap, the plot of the reconstructed feature and the map.
For further info, see the contents of the script.

## heatmap.R

Create a heatmap of the ancestral states per language family.

## map.R

Create a map of the geographical distribution of the languages in the sample.

## plot_reconstructed_feature_on_tree.R

Create a plot with the reconstructed states for one feature on the tree.
